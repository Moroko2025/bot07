/**
 * A* Search Heuristic for Tron-like game.
 *
 * This algorithm evaluates possible moves using the A* search algorithm.
 * It tries to find paths from the bot's current position to the largest open space.
 * The cost function favors moves that maximize reachable free squares while avoiding obstacles.
 *
 * The heuristic used is the Manhattan distance, considering wrap-around board behavior.
 *
 * A* is a search algorithm that finds the shortest path from a start point to a goal. However, in this game,
 * it is not used to find a specific goal but rather to estimate the best direction based on the number of reachable squares.
 *
 * Key Ideas:
 * Evaluating directions – The algorithm tries to determine which move will allow the bot to claim the most free squares.
 * Priority Queue – We use this data structure to explore the best options first.
 * Cost function (g + h):
 * g (cost so far) – The number of steps taken from the start position.
 * h (heuristic estimate) – The estimated distance to free areas (based on Manhattan distance).
 * Processing possible moves – The algorithm evaluates each possible direction.
 * How the algorithm works in the code:
 * It evaluates all possible directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
 *
 * It calculates where the bot would move next (considering wrap-around board behavior).
 * If the target square is free, it runs A* from that position.
 * A explores the area from the given position:*
 *
 * A priority queue is used to order squares based on their g + h cost.
 * Free neighboring squares are added and processed until the reachable area is fully explored.
 * Final output:
 *
 * For each direction, the algorithm calculates a score = the number of reachable squares.
 * The direction with the highest score is likely the best move.
 * Potential optimizations and improvements:
 * Considering opponents: The algorithm currently ignores where opponents are—it could include a penalty for areas near enemy bots.
 * Limiting search depth: We can restrict the maximum number of steps to avoid excessive computation.
 * Advanced heuristics: For example, incorporating the probability of survival in different areas.
